# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS-GAME
Project-13: Rock Paper Scissors Game
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python using text-based input and ASCII art. The game allows a user to play against the computer by choosing between three classic hand signs: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

🎮 How It Works
The player is prompted to select:
0 for Rock
1 for Paper
2 for Scissors

The computer randomly selects its move.

Scissors beats Paper
ASCII art is used to visually represent each choice.
